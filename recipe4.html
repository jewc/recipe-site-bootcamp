    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

      <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>

        STEP 1 Tip the flour into a bowl, drizzle in 2 tbsp water and mix to
        form a thick batter. Season with plenty of salt and freshly ground black
        pepper, then mix in the courgettes.
      </li>

        STEP 2 Pour oil into a pan until it is about 4cm deep, ensuring the pan
        is no more than two thirds full. Set over a medium heat until 180C or a
        flick of batter dropped in sizzles and turns brown within 30 seconds.
        Lower half the battered courgettes into the hot oil and fry, turning
        after 1 min using a slotted spoon, for 5-6 mins until golden. If they
        begin to stick together, gently coax them apart with tongs. Remove from
        the hot oil and drain on a plate lined with a sheet of kitchen paper.
        Repeat with the remaining half, then scatter with the parmesan before
        serving.
